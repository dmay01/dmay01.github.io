I am a **PhD Student** in the [High Performance Computing (HPC) Research Group](https://hpc.ec.tuwien.ac.at) at [TU Wien](https://www.tuwien.at), Austria. The group is led by [Prof. Ivona Brandić](https://www.ec.tuwien.ac.at/~ivona/index.html) and is part of the **Institute of Information Systems Engineering**. My research focuses on **AI, sustainability, and energy efficiency**, with a particular interest in optimizing AI workloads for resource-constrained environments.

I earned my **Master’s degree in Business Informatics** from TU Wien in 2025. Before starting my PhD, I worked as a **Research Assistant** in the HPC Group, contributing to projects on energy-efficient AI applications. My work involves techniques like **multi-objective optimization** to balance performance and energy consumption in AI systems.

I am passionate about making AI more **sustainable and efficient**. If you're interested in collaborating or learning more about my research, feel free to reach out!
